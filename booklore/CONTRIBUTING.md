### 3. Backend Setup

#### a. Configure `application-dev.yml`

Create or edit `booklore-api/src/main/resources/application-dev.yml`:

```yaml
app:
  path-book: '/path/to/booklore/books'      # Directory for book/comic files
  path-config: '/path/to/booklore/config'   # Directory for thumbnails, metadata, etc.

spring:
  datasource:
    driver-class-name: org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver
    url: jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3333/booklore?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true
    username: root
    password: Password123
```

> 🔧 Replace `/path/to/...` with actual local paths

#### b. Run the Backend

```bash
cd booklore-api
./gradlew bootRun
```
